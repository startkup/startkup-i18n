11/22 Google Cloud 101 Cloud Basic Series of Courses: The Use of Cloud Skills Boost

&nbsp;

We appreciate the participation of all the members in our third session of the cloud series of courses.

This time, President Johnny gave an introduction to the history of Cloud Skills Boost and its relation to Qwiklabs, providing a detailed explanation of each tab, information panel, and other functions of the platform.

Johnny guided us through a lab (scenario-based practical lesson) on the Cloud Skills Boost platform and successfully applied for a free one-month subscription.

&nbsp;

Course Summary:

The second session of the Cloud Basic series of courses involved hands-on experience with the Cloud Skills Boost platform and obtaining a free one-month subscription. This not only facilitates the connection to the next course but also allows independent exploration of scenario-based questions within the platform.

&nbsp;

Next Tuesday, we will have the second-to-last session of our Google Cloud courses, focusing on Compute Engine (VM) deployment. We strongly encourage our members who hope to learn seizing this opportunity!
