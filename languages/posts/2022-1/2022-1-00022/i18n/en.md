11/22 Google Cloud 101 Cloud Basics Series: Cloud Skills Boost Operation

&nbsp;

We appreciate the participation of all members in our third session of the cloud series courses.

This time, President Johnny introduced the history of Cloud Skills Boost and its relationship with Qwiklabs, providing a detailed explanation of each tab, information panel, and other functionalities of the platform.

Johnny guided us through a lab (scenario-based practical exercise) on the Cloud Skills Boost platform and successfully applied for a free one-month subscription.

&nbsp;

Course Summary:

The second session of this Cloud Basics Series course involved hands-on experience with the Cloud Skills Boost platform and obtaining a free one-month subscription. This not only facilitates the transition to the next course but also allows for independent exploration of scenario-based questions within the platform.

&nbsp;

Next Tuesday, we will have the second-to-last session of our Google Cloud course, focusing on Compute Engine (VM) deployment. We encourage members who wish to learn to seize this opportunity!
