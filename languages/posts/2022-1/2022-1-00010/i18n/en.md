UI/UX Lecture:

How can Product UI/UX Designers Survive in the Software Industry?

&nbsp;

Today (October 11th), we had the honor of inviting Ms. Zhang Jingyuan, an industry expert from an online teaching platform,

To lead us in understanding the importance of UI/UX, different types of designers, the software industry ecosystem, and project workflows.

&nbsp;

Real-life case studies were also incorporated into the course.

such as the poor UI of Citibank leading to employee errors.

&nbsp;

She then introduced UI and UX,

highlighting how Google defines a good user experience:

&nbsp;

\- Usable

\- Equitable

\- Enjoyable

\- Useful

&nbsp;

That is, being user-friendly, fair, enjoyable, and useful.

What is the difference between usable and useful?

It depends on whether everyone has attended the classes properly.

&nbsp;

The instructor will also guide us through the work and process involved in UX.

We will learn about the companies where UI/UX designers usually work.

Finally, we will be introduced to the roles and responsibilities in project processes.

&nbsp;

We appreciate teacher Jingyuan for giving us a preliminary understanding of UI/UX.

She also shared a lot of industry-related experiences!

&nbsp;

Next class: October 25th, Google Cloud Developer Technical Training Program.

See you there!
