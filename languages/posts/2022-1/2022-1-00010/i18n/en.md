**[Course Review | October 11 | UI/UX Lecture]**

October 11, 2022

UI/UX Lecture:

How can Product UI/UX Designers Survive in the Software Industry?

&nbsp;

Today (October 11) we invited Teacher Zhang Jingyuan, an industrial expert from an online teaching platform.

She guided us to understand the importance of UI/UX, the types and differences of designers, the software industry, and project management workflow.

&nbsp;

Real-life cases were also incorporated into the lecture,

for instance, the poor UI leading to employee errors in Citibank.

&nbsp;

She then introduced UI and UX,

highlighting how Google defines a good user experience:

&nbsp;

\- Usable

\- Equitable

\- Enjoyable

\- Useful

&nbsp;

That is, usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful.

What is the difference between usable and useful?

It depends on whether you attended the lecture attentively.

&nbsp;

The lecturer also introduced us to the tasks and processes involved in UX,

the types of companies where UI/UX designers typically work,

and finally, the job roles in project management!

&nbsp;

We appreciate Teacher Jingyuan letting us gain initial understanding of UI/UX

and sharing lots of practical experience!

See you there!
