The largest immersive projection exhibition in Tamkang University's student club, "The dim light of dawn : AI Unveiled," overcame various challenges and constantly generated creative ideas. This exhibition not only showcases the latest public applications of AI but also utilizes projection technology to allow students to experience immersive sensory stimulation free of charge.

At the end of the exhibition, you can also experience an AI game and collaborate with game development societies to create a captivating fusion of AI and projection.
