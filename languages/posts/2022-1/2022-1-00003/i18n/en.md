**[ September 3 | Freshmen Club Experience Festival Ã— Artificial Innovative Intelligence Club ]**

The one and only projection exhibition in our school, "The Dim Light of Dawn", is about to open!

&nbsp;

"The Dim Light of Dawn: AI Unveiled" is the biggest immersive projection debut exhibition held by a Tamkang University club. By overcoming all obstacles and constantly conceiving creative ideas, this exhibition not only showcases the latest public applications of AI but also utilizes projection technology to allow students to experience immersive sensory stimulation free of charge.

At the end of the exhibition, you can also experience AI games. We collaborate with Game Development Club in creating a captivating fusion of AI and projection. Each exhibition space is unique and exciting, providing participants with a sensory spectacle that is entirely different from the appearance of AI.
