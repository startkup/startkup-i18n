**[Event Postponed | September 4 | Freshmen Club Experience Festival × Artificial Innovative Intelligence Club ]**

【The event has been postponed】

Although Extracurricular Activities Guidance Section had decided to cancel the Freshmen Club Experience Festival;

however,we actively contacted with Extracurricular Activities Guidance Section, and discussed the alternative plan as follows:

&nbsp;

☀️ On Friday, September 2, our team and the firms set up as usual.

☀️ On Saturday, September 3, internal soft opening will not open to the public

☀️ 11:00-16:00, Saturday, September 4, opens ✨

☀️ The recording will be available to those who are unable to attend.

&nbsp;

While you can see the exhibition through the recording, it's not quite the same as experiencing it in person. You're welcome to attend it when you have time!
