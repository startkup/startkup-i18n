[111-1 Club Course Registration Forms]

üì£üì£ Here are all the club course registration forms!

&nbsp;

We will be holding a training program including two types of courses for the first time.

(The lecturer thought that 2 hours were not enough),

So we'll hold another 2-week sessions on cloud!

Each session of these courses is 1 hour long. There will be a total of 5 sessions for Google Cloud and 4 sessions for ML Machine Learning.

And ‚ú® don't forget to attend the General Meeting for amending the club's regulations!

\----

The first cloud session will commence on October 25, 2022, led by our club president who has set up Google Cloud servers for everyone. The sessions after that until December 6, 2022 will be inviting the speakers from Google Developers Group. We will announce more details about the speakers soon. Stay tuned! üòö

As for ML Machine Learning, you will gain an in-depth understanding and learn from Google Developer Experts (GDE).This type of courses will begin after the midterm exams, and further information is expected to be public by then.
