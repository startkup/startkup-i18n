[111-1 All Club Course Registration Forms]

üì£üì£ All club course registration forms are here!

Next, we will be holding a series of training programs for our first two types of courses.

(The instructor mentioned that the original duration of 2 hours per session was too short),

So we have extended the courses on our cloud platform for an additional 2 weeks!

Each session of these courses is 1 hour long. There will be a total of 5 sessions for Google Cloud, amounting to 5 hours, and 4 sessions for ML Machine Learning, totaling 4 hours.

And don't forget ‚ú® the General Assembly for amending the club's bylaws that all members must attend!

\----

The first session on the cloud will commence on 2022/10/25, led by our club president, who has set up Google Cloud servers for everyone's direct use. The final session on 2022/12/06 will be conducted by speakers from Google Developers Group. More detailed information about the speakers will be announced soon. Stay tuned! üòö

ML Machine Learning will be taught throughout the program by a Google Developer Expert (GDE) specialized in machine learning, providing us with an in-depth understanding of the subject.This course will begin after the midterm exams, and further information is expected to be announced during the midterm exam week.
