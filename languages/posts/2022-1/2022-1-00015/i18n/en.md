[Club Official Calendar]

ðŸ”¥ The club official calendar is now available! ðŸ”¥

&nbsp;

"Do we have club activities this week?"

"Where are the club activities held?"

These might come to your mind when missing the announcements regarding club courses.

&nbsp;

Now, in addition to posting the information on our Instagram and Discord before each session,

we also have all the activities listed on the calendar!

The time and location of each session are included,

and we will update the content of each course in the upcoming future.

&nbsp;

Apart from accessing the calendar directly through the provided link,

you can also add it to your own calendar for easily checking available time slots to attend the courses.

How convenient it is! ðŸ˜Š

&nbsp;

Don't forget to like and bookmark the calendar so that you won't miss any updates!
