[Official Club Calendar]

🔥 The official club calendar is now available! 🔥

&nbsp;

「Do we have club activities this week?」

「Where are the club activities held?」

These might be the questions that come to mind if members miss the announcements about club activities.

&nbsp;

Now, in addition to posting the information on the club's Instagram and Discord before each session,

we have also created a calendar for all our activities!

The calendar includes the time and location of each session,

and we will also update it with the content of each class in the future.

&nbsp;

Apart from accessing the calendar directly through the provided link,

you can also add it to your own calendar for easy access to the schedule and to check for available time slots to attend the classes.

Isn't it convenient? 😊 😊

&nbsp;

Don't forget to like and bookmark the calendar so you won't miss any updates!
