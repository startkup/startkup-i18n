[Course Review | 111-1 Cloud Series Course Session 2]

Thank you to all the club members who participated in our second session of the Cloud Series course. This time, it was taught by Teacher Max. Teacher Max provided a basic introduction to the GCP platform, discussed how to take the first step in using cloud platforms, introduced common GCP services and resources, and provided an overview of GCP platform tools. Finally, Teacher Max shared their own experience using cloud platforms.

In addition to the informative lectures, Teacher Max also kindly provided the Google slides used in this session. The slides include links to the websites of each service tool, allowing everyone to use them directly.
