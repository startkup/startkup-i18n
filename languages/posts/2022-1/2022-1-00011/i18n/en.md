üöÄ Project Development:

Our club is currently working on two ongoing projects: TKUGERS, a course recommendation system for Tamkang University's General Education Program, and a Tai Chi scoring system.The technologies and project descriptions are illustrated in the image. Here are a few benefits of participating in a project:

1\. Recognition: Our projects involve collaboration with professors from seven departments at the university. Once completed, they will be deployed online for the entire student body to use.Having your name associated with a platform that can be used by all students and faculty is quite an impressive accomplishment!

2\. Distinctiveness: Working on a project sets you apart from your peers and enhances your competitiveness for master's program applications and job interviews!

3\. Teamwork: Most projects in school are done alone or with a few classmates. Here, you'll have the opportunity to collaborate with partners from different departments and years, opening up endless possibilities!

4\. ...and there's so much more to talk about! If you want to know more, ask the club president (*‚âßœâ‚â¶)

üìñ Study Groups:

Our club aims to provide not only technical support but also a platform for like-minded individuals to showcase their talents.Therefore, in addition to projects, we also encourage members to form study groups or interest groups.Most importantly, regardless of the field, whether it's programming, graphic design, brewing coffee, or baking cookies, you can find your place here!
