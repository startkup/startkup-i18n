🚀 Project Development

Our club is currently working on two projects: TKUGERS, a course recommendation system for Tamkang University's general education, and a Tai Chi Quan scoring system.The project descriptions and used technologies are illustrated in the photos. Here we simply list several benefits of participating in a project:

1\. Recognition: Our projects involve collaboration with professors from seven departments at the university. Once completed, they will be deployed online for the entire student body to use.Having your name associated with a platform that can be used by all students and faculty is quite an impressive accomplishment, right?

2\. Distinctiveness: Working on a project sets you apart from your peers and enhances your competitiveness for master's program applications and job interviews!

3\. Teamwork: Most projects in school are done alone or with a few classmates. Here, you'll have the opportunity to collaborate with partners from different departments and years, opening up endless possibilities!

4\. ...and there's so much more to talk about! If you want to know more, come and ask our president (*≧ω≦)

📖 Study Groups

我們社團不僅提供技術支援，更鼓勵大家都能在這裡找到志同道合的人並一展長才。Therefore, besides projects, we also encourage everyone to form study groups or interest groups.On top of that, regardless of the field, whether it's programming, graphic design, brewing coffee, or baking cookies, you can find your place here!
