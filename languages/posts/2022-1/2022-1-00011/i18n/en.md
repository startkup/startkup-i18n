🚀 Project Development:

Our club is currently working on two ongoing projects: TKUGERS, a course recommendation system for Tamkang University's General Education Program, and a Tai Chi scoring system.The technologies and project descriptions are illustrated in the image. Here are a few benefits of participating in a project:

1\. 留名—我們做的專案跟學校共7個系所的老師合作，未來做出來會推上線供全校師生使用。Having your name associated with a platform that can be used by all students and faculty is quite an impressive accomplishment!

2\. 鑑別度—做專案就是讓你與同學不同的地方，提高碩士推甄及職場面試競爭力！

3\. 團隊合作—在學校做專題多半是一個人或是同班三五好友，這裡你能結識各系各年級的夥伴，跟著不同領域的人團隊合作創造無限可能！

4\. …還有太多可以講了，想知道更多來問社長 (*≧ω≦)

📖 Study Groups:

Our club aims to provide not only technical support but also a platform for like-minded individuals to showcase their talents.Therefore, in addition to projects, we also encourage members to form study groups or interest groups.Most importantly, regardless of the field, whether it's programming, graphic design, brewing coffee, or baking cookies, you can find your place here!
