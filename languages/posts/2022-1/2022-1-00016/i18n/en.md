[111-1 Announcement of Activity Participation Journal Delayed Submission]

⚠️Very important!Very important!Very important!⚠️

It's a terrible mistake to NOT register the activity on October 25 with TKU Learning and Practice of Clubs System, which means members will not find the activity listed on the system and not be able to submit their Activity Participation Journals.

But don't worry!We have found a solution. 🙇🏻‍♂️ 🙇🏻‍♂️

&nbsp;

For those who need to fill out the Activity Participation Journal for their second Participation Certificate (who attended any of the sessions on 10/11, 10/18, or 10/25), please submit your journal under the "10/28 TKUAIIC Kuan Du Light Art Festival Outing" activity on the Learning and Practice of Clubs System, available on Saturday, October 28, 2022.

As for the content, you can fill in the lectures you attended. It doesn't have to be related to the outing or include your reflections on it.
