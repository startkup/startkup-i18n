[111-1 Participation Certificate Activity Journal Delayed Submission Announcements]

⚠️Very important!Very important!Very important!⚠️

Due to some administrative oversight, we failed to register the activity on 10/25 in the school's Club Learning and Practice Course System. This means that members will not see the activity listed on the system, and they won't be able to submit their activity journals.

But don't worry!We have prepared a solution. 🙇🏻‍♂️ 🙇🏻‍♂️

&nbsp;

For those who need to fill out the activity journal for their second participation certification (meaning you attended any of the sessions on 10/11, 10/18, or 10/25), please submit it under the "10/28 Tamkang AI Creativity Club Guandu Light Art Festival Outing" activity in the club's practice system starting from 2022/10/28 (Saturday).

As for the content, you can fill in the lectures you attended. It doesn't have to be related to the outing or include your reflections on it.
