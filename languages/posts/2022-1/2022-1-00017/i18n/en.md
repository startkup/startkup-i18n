[Course Review | 2022-10-25 | Google Cloud 101: Cloud Basic Series of Courses - Intro]

Thank you all for participating in our first session of the Cloud series of courses. President Johnny introduced what cloud computing is, why we use the cloud, what Google Cloud is, and what Cloud Skill Boost is.

Cloud Skill Boost is the platform used for this course and also used by Google for teaching cloud technologies!That's right! What we use are the official materials from Google!

We are honored to have had a one-month free subscription to Google Cloud Skill Boost, allowing all of you to fully explore the platform to your heart's content, practice the course content, and independently solve various situation-based questions on the platform.

And all because of this platform, we can provide students with the most practical hands-on workshops!

Course Summary:

The first session of this Cloud Basic series of courses focused on introducing the basics and familiarizing everyone with the interface of Cloud Skill Boost. After finishing a scenario-based lab course, each of students would have a one-month subscription.

This session served as an initial assignment. After the midterm week, we will have Max (a.k.a. Sakana), the Google Developer Expert (GDE) specialized in cloud technologies, leading a four-week workshop consisting of four sessions.
