[Course Review | 2022-10-25 | Google Cloud 101: Cloud Basics Series - Intro]

Thank you to all the club members for participating in our first session of the Cloud Series course. President Johnny introduced what cloud computing is, why we use the cloud, what Google Cloud is, and what CloudSkillBoost is.

CloudSkillBoost is the educational platform we are using for this course, and it's also the platform officially used by Google for teaching cloud technologies!That's right, we are using official Google materials!

We are honored to have obtained a one-month free pass from Google for CloudSkillBoost, allowing all of you to fully explore the platform and engage in various scenario-based exercises. Students can not only practice the course content but also independently explore different situations on the platform.

Because of this platform, we can provide students with the most practical hands-on workshops!

Course Summary:

本雲端基礎系列課的第一堂就是做基本介紹並讓大家知道熟悉CloudSkillBoost的操作介面並在完成一個情境實驗課後取得一個月通行證。

This session served as an initial assignment, and after the midterm, we will have Max (aka Sakana), a Google Developer Expert (GDE) in cloud technologies, leading a four-week workshop consisting of four sessions.
