üìéManagement Information System Training Courses

Our school often struggles to find students who are capable of being network administrators, and those students may not be aware of this part-time job opportunity.

Serving as a platform for talent matching, our club actively collaborate with school departments on cultivating outstanding network administrators with both software and hardware knowledge.

&nbsp;

For the software aspect of this course, we will use the RHCSA certification materials from Red Hat to ensure that students learn the most solid and Linux knowledge certified by industries.

In terms of hardware, for the first session, we have invited the Computer Hardware Research Club @tku_chc to explain the components of consumer-grade computers and provide each student with a computer for hands-on assembly. The second session will be deliverd by our President, who will explain the components of enterprise-grade servers and teach students how to cut network wires.

&nbsp;

Both the software courses and the hardware courses are solid and comprehensive. Whether you are interested in management information system or you want to learn a valuable skill, don't miss them!
