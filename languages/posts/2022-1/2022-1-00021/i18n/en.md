📎 Sysadmin Training Courses

Many departments in the school often struggle to find students who are capable of being network administrators, and even capable students may not be aware of this part-time job opportunity.

Our club serves as a platform for talent matchmaking, and we actively collaborate with school departments to cultivate outstanding network administrators with both software and hardware knowledge.

For the software aspect of this course, we will use the RHCSA certification materials from Red Hat to ensure that students learn the most solid and industry-certified Linux knowledge.

In terms of hardware, for the first session, we have invited the Computer Hardware Research Club @tku_chc to explain the components of consumer-grade computers and provide each student with a computer for hands-on assembly. The second session will be taught by President, who will explain the components of enterprise-grade servers and teach students how to crimp network cables.

Both the software and hardware aspects of this training course have solid and comprehensive content. Whether you are interested in network administration or want to learn a valuable skill, you should not miss it!
