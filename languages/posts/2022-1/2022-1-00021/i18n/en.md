📎 Sysadmin Training Courses

Many departments in the school often struggle to find students who are capable of being network administrators, and even capable students may not be aware of this part-time job opportunity.

Our club serves as a platform for talent matchmaking, and we actively collaborate with school departments to cultivate outstanding network administrators with both software and hardware knowledge.

本課程軟體方面會採用Red Hat紅帽的RHCSA證照教材，讓學員能夠學到最紮實、有業界認證的Linux知識。

硬體方面第一堂我們邀請了電腦硬體研習社 @tku_chc 講解消費者等級電腦的零件並配給每位學員一臺電腦來學習實體組裝，而第二堂則是由社長講解企業級伺服器的元件並教學員如何剪網路線。

&nbsp;

本培訓課不論軟、硬體課程內容皆紮實且豐富，不論您是對網管有興趣又或者想要學一技之長的千萬不要錯過！
