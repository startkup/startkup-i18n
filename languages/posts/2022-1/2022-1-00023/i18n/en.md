# [Course Review | 2022-11-24 | ML Machine Learning Course: TensorFlow]

11/24 ML Machine Learning Course TensorFlow: Introduction

Thank you all for participating in our first session of the ML Machine Learning Course.

This time, we have invited Jerry Wu, a Google Developer Expert (GDE) in machine learning and the founder of APMIC, to teach us about the application of Google's machine learning framework, TensorFlow.

The class content includes explaining the necessary knowledge of machine learning, understanding that machine learning is not about designing programs for object or image recognition using rule-based (if, else) approaches, but rather determining images by repeatedly calculating accuracy values using a large amount of data and labels.

Next, the instructor personally guides us to use the Iris flower dataset and TensorFlow on the Google Colab platform to build a simple machine learning model.

&nbsp;

Course Summary:

This course is not just about theoretical learning; it also includes practical exercises in building machine learning models.In addition to interacting with the instructor, you can also ask questions about machine learning.We believe that all members will benefit greatly from this session!

&nbsp;

The next ML Study Jam will be held on 12/01. See you next time!
