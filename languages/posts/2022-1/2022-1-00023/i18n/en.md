# [Course Review | 2022-11-24 | ML Machine Learning Course: TensorFlow]

11/24 ML Machine Learning Course TensorFlow: Introduction

Thank you all for participating in our first session of the ML Machine Learning Course.

This time, we were having Jerry Wu, the Google Developer Expert (GDE) specialized in machine learning and the founder of APMIC, teach us the application of TensorFlow regarding Google's machine learning framework.

The lesson includes explaining the necessary knowledge of machine learning, understanding that machine learning is not designing programs for object or image recognition by using rule-based approaches (if and else), but rather determining images by repeatedly calculating accuracy values using a large amount of data and labels.

Next, Jerry guides us to use the Iris flower dataset and TensorFlow on the Google Colab platform to build a simple machine learning model.

Course Summary:

This course is not just about theoretical learning; it also includes practical exercises in building machine learning models.In addition to interacting with the lecturer, you can also ask questions about machine learning.We believe that all the members gained a lot from this session!

&nbsp;

The next ML Study Jam course will be held on 12/01. See you next time!
