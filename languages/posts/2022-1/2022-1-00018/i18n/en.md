üìé Google Cloud 101 Cloud Basics Series Course

According to iThome's survey, over 60% of businesses believe that cloud services are helpful for digital transformation.

In reality, cloud computing is omnipresent in our daily lives, encompassing mobile applications, instant messaging, and email communication, all relying on cloud infrastructure.

But which cloud platform should you learn?

The three major public cloud platforms globally are Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS) by Amazon, and Azure by Microsoft.
