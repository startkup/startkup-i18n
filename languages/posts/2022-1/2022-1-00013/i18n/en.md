[2022-10-28 | Club Outing | 2022 Guandu Light Art Festival "Jiji"]

Our first club outing is hereÔΩû üì£

We will be visiting the "2022 Guandu Light Art Festival: Jiji" ‚ú®

This club outing aims to strengthen the bonds and understanding among club members, while cultivating their interest in light and shadow technology. It also serves as an opportunity to find inspiration and ideas for future light and shadow exhibitions within our club, providing members and executives with a reference direction.

Through the light art festival, club members can get to know each other and foster their interest in light and shadow technology. This will allow them to accumulate experience and passion, enabling them to fully showcase their talents and creativity in future light and shadow exhibitions.

We look forward to the participation of all club members. See you next Friday! ü§©
