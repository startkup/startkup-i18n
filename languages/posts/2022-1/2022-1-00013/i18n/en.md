[2022-10-28 | Club Outing | 2022 Kuan Du Light Art Festival "Ji-Ji"]

Here comes our first club outing~ üì£

We will be attending the 2022 Kuan Du Light Art Festival "Ji-Ji" ‚ú®

This club outing aims to enhance cohesion of club members and have chemistry with each other, while cultivating their interest in light and shadow technology. It also serves as an opportunity to find inspiration and ideas for light and shadow exhibitions within our club in the future, providing club members and cadres with a direction.

Through the light art festival, club members can get to know each other better and foster their interest in light and shadow technology, allowing them to accumulate experience and passion and to fully showcase their talents and creativity in light and shadow exhibitions in the days to come.

We look forward to participation of all the club members. See you next Friday! ü§©
