**[ General Meeting & Orientation Event ]**

"What can we learn from the club courses of the Artificial Innovative Intelligence Club?"

This is probably the most frequently question being asked about our club.

&nbsp;

At March 22 (next week),

there will be a formal event to introduce our club courses!

&nbsp;

Anyone who want to figure out what our club is about can participate this event,

and understand more about our club, including club courses, benefits, etc.

There will have some AI-related group games, icebreakers,

to help the club members to familiarize each other.

We hope that in the future, you will have more opportunities to communicate with like-minded friends!

&nbsp;

If any of you are still unsure about joining us, we welcome your presence!
