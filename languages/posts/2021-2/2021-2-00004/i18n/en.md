**[ General Meeting & Orientation Event ]**

"What can we learn from the club courses of the Artificial Innovative Intelligence Club?"

This is probably the most frequently question being asked about our club.

&nbsp;

At March 22 (next week),

there will be a formal event to introduce our club courses!

&nbsp;

Anyone who want to figure out what our club is about can participate this event,

and understand more about our club, including club courses, benefits, etc.

There will have some AI-related group games, icebreakers,

to help the club members to familiarize each other.

期許各位在未來能夠和志同道合的朋友多多交流！

&nbsp;

如果有還在猶豫加入我們的同學也歡迎您的到來！
