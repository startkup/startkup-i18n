I am WU Yue-shyuan (吳岳軒), majoring in Education Technology. This semester, I am serving as one of the Public Relation Officers at the AII Club. Leon Ri-yang YUAN (袁日揚) is my partner.

When the club was first established, I joined out of curiosity, and now, I feel like a part of the big family. It brings me great happiness to meet and get to know the companions from different backgrounds.

Hello everyone, I'm YUAN Ri-yang (袁日揚), one of the Public Relation Officers in the club. Currently, I'm a freshman in the Department of Aerospace Engineering. I enjoy playing sports, video games, and going out to have fun. A 50-word self-introduction is too brief, so please join our club to unlock more details about me!
