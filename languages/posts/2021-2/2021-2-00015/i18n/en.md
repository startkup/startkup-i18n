I am Justin ? WU, majoring in Education and Technology. This semester, I am serving as the Public Relations officer at the AI Club.Leon Ri-yang YUAN (袁日揚) is my partner.

When the club was first established, I joined out of curiosity and now I feel like a part of a big family. It brings me great happiness to meet and get to know companions from different backgrounds.

Hello everyone, I'm Leon Ri-yang YUAN, a public relations student. Currently, I'm a freshman in Aerospace Engineering. I enjoy playing sports, video games, and going out to have fun. A 50-word self-introduction is too brief, so for more information, please ask the Artificial Innovative Intelligence Club to unlock more details about me :)
