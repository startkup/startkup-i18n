"AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a kind of technological engineering for dream realization and goal achievement." -- Kelvin from the Grad. Inst. and Dept. of IB <br /> "AI makes us live in a more convenient way." -- Johnny from the Dept. of ECE <br /> "AI is an intelligent thing made by humans." -- Justin from the Dept. of ET

We are the Tamkang University Artificial Innovative Intelligence Club. <br /> Our core value is "being people-oriented" (Traditional Chinese: "以人為本"). <br /> Our club ideologies are "For the Things that People are Willing to Have" (Traditional Chinese: "人所欲，施於人") and "Together, We Create" (Traditional Chinese: "共同創造"). <br /> With these values and ideologies, we want to create a clear and visible future.

We believe every single student should be able to get self-learning resources.<br /> We want to help students to learn practical knowledge and skills.
