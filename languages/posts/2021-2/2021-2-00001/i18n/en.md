**[ The Foundation of the Club ]**

With the wishes and hopes,

and the hard work from the crew members...

&nbsp;

Finally, we founded our club on March 11!

"AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a kind of technological engineering for dream realization and goal achievement." <br />-- Kelvin from the Grad. Inst. and Dept. of IB

"AI makes us live in a more convenient way." <br />-- Johnny from the Dept. of ECE

"AI is an intelligent thing made by humans." <br />-- Justin from the Dept. of ET

&nbsp;

How about you? What is the impression of AI that your have?

&nbsp;

We are the Tamkang University Artificial Innovative Intelligence Club.

Our core value is "being people-oriented" (Traditional Chinese: "以人為本").

Our club ideologies are "For the Things that People are Willing to Have" (Traditional Chinese: "人所欲，施於人") and "Together, We Create" (Traditional Chinese: "共同創造").

With these values and ideologies,

we want to create a clear and visible future.

&nbsp;

We believe every single student should be able to get self-learning resources.

We want to help students to learn practical knowledge and skills.
