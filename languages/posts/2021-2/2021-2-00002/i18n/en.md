2. Medium-sized: 3 courses, with the total of 6 hours

3. Small-sized: 8 courses, with the total of 16 hours

&nbsp;

\- School-wide -

With these school-wide lectures and workshops,

we hope that everyone can know how to bring and combine AI to their field of study.

&nbsp;

另外也會輔導大家做職涯探索，

針對人資、履歷相關議題進行授課、實作，

幫助以後進入職場的同學更容易找到自己的出路！

&nbsp;

It is also hoped that we could invite YouTubers

to share their knowledge and experiences about internet marketing.

&nbsp;

\- Workshops -

Listening to the school courses everyday makes you feel very tired, right?

想要學習又可以馬上實作的上課模式，

工作坊的課程絕對不會讓你想睡覺的！

&nbsp;

這部分課程如果有需要C執行認證的同學可以報名，

當工作坊的助教，協助同學們實作。

&nbsp;

\- Small-sized Lectures -

Want to learn something about metaverse, blockchain or marketing data science?

These lectures are all held for club members!

&nbsp;

｜💎 Benefits for participating in club activities｜

\- Certification & Course Certificate -

參與社課除了可以在某些課程中拿到BC參與/執行認證外，

還希望能夠給予社員們修課證明，

增加各自領域中的競爭力。

&nbsp;

\- Corporate Visits -

We're also planning some corporate visits,

帶我們更深入瞭解企業願景、文化、產業發展趨勢等，

讓學生提早做好規畫及儲備職場核心能力

&nbsp;

\- Certificate Examinations -

We encourage our members to examine what they learned,

and become the highlights of their résumé.

These will becoma the strong proof of their abilities, especially in cross-subject development.
