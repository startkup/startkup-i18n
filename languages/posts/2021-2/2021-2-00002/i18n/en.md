You only need to pay $200 TWD/semester to get the membership of the club!

With the membership of our club, you can attend about 13 lectures and workshops held by our club with the total of 46 hours.

Special thanks to the supports and sponsors from College of Engineering and College of Artificial Innovative Intelligence,

including the perfect places and facilities they provided and the financial support for lectures and workshops.

｜🪄 Plans for the Club Courses｜

The AI-related courses we planned are divided into the following types:

1. School-wide: 2 courses, with the total of 24 hours

2. Medium-sized: 3 courses, with the total of 6 hours

3. Small-sized: 8 courses, with the total of 16 hours

&nbsp;

\- School-wide -

With these school-wide lectures and workshops,

we hope that everyone can know how to bring and combine AI to their field of study.

&nbsp;

Also, we would provide assistance for career explorations,

including learning and practices, targeting human resources and résumé related things,

to help them find their own way out more easily when they enter the workplace in the future.

&nbsp;

It is also hoped that we could invite YouTubers

to share their knowledge and experiences about internet marketing.

&nbsp;

\- Workshops -

Listening to the school courses everyday makes you feel very tired, right?

If you want to have some hands-on learning,

just participate our workshop without being tired!

&nbsp;

If you need the Administration Certification (part C), you can enroll this type of the activities,

be one of the activity staffs as a teaching assistant in the workshop, to get the certificate.

&nbsp;

\- Small-sized Lectures -

Want to learn something about metaverse, blockchain or marketing data science?

These lectures are all hold for club members!

&nbsp;

｜💎 Benefits for participating in club activities｜

參與社課除了可以在某些課程中拿到BC參與/執行認證外，

還希望能夠給予社員們修課證明，

增加各自領域中的競爭力。

&nbsp;

帶我們更深入瞭解企業願景、文化、產業發展趨勢等，

讓學生提早做好規畫及儲備職場核心能力
