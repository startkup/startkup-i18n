Hello everyone, I'm CHENG Hung-hsuan (é„­æ³“è»’), a freshman majoring in the Department of Artificial Intelligence. My interests are computers and various types of film and television works. I recently moved from Tainan and I've been here for less than a year. There's still a lot for me to learn, and I hope to have the opportunity to interact with all of you more.
